What is the Space Research Library (SRL)? How can it benefit my organization?  Who are our members? New members start here!


## What is the SRL?
The SRL is intended to be a repository of learning - coordinating and sharing information among space research institutions of all kinds.  Our hope is that we can speed research along by facilitating the spread of information.  We have a commitment to open source research.
